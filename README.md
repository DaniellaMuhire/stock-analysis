# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of the stock-analysis in general is to analyze a handful of green energy stocks for investement purpose. The stocks data are stored in Excel files and we use Visual Basic for Applications(VBA) to automate tasks for different analyses. We also refactor the code to make it more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code.
